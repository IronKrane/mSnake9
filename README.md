# mSnake9
Classic game of snake written in Python.
Game works but needs refinement.

TODO list:
1. make the snake movement base on the grid
2. refine collision check with the body
3. spice up the game with different kind of foods (maybe?)
4. add sound effects
5. two-player version, that would be cool
6. GUI with some settings
7. NEAT AI algorithm ?
